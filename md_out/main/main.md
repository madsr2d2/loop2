## **1 Executive summary**

## **2 Introduction**

Egholm A/S develops and manufactures professional utility machines used by municipalities, institutions, and landscaping workers for tasks such as sweeping, collection, green maintenance, and winter service. The company increasingly aims to work with energy efficiency as a central competitive parameter, as runtime, environmental impact, and user experience are all directly affected by how the machines are operated in daily use. In this context, Egholm is exploring how new technologies including telematics, data analysis, AI, and behavioural design can support smarter and more energy-efficient operation.
Currently, Egholm collects only limited data from their machines (see Appendix A). The company does not yet use GPS or telematics on machines in operation, although they have begun collaborating with a supplier to develop a future telematics solution. This means they currently lack systematic insight into real-world usage patterns, energy consumption, and operator behaviour but are actively exploring how such systems can be integrated into the next generation of machines.
Another challenge identified in the email is that users operate the machines very differently (see Appendix A). Operators may, for example, use higher power levels than necessary during standard tasks, which leads to unnecessary energy consumption. This indicates that there are known areas where energy usage could be reduced if operators changed their behaviour or received more effective feedback while working. Egholm is therefore interested in solutions that can motivate operators to use the machines more energyefficiently without restricting their ability to complete their tasks.
Egholm has previously attempted to improve energy efficiency through technical updates, such as software improvements that do not depend on user behaviour (see Appendix A). However, these measures only address one part of the problem. The larger challenge is behavioural: operators are primarily focused on completing their tasks quickly and effectively, and therefore rarely consider energy consumption (see Appendix A). This suggests that technical optimization alone will not be sufficient; future solutions must take operator decision-making, information flow, and motivation into account.
Professional operators often work under time pressure and with a wide variety of tasks throughout the day. This makes it unrealistic to expect them to manually optimize between different power modes, even if doing so would save energy. Systems that automate recommendations, provide simple visual feedback, or intelligently adjust power levels to the task may therefore play an important role.
At the same time, the lack of telematics in current models limits Egholm's ability to document energy savings, identify inefficient operating patterns, or provide customers with data-driven arguments for improving usage (see Appendix A). A future telematics platform potentially combined with AI could therefore become a key component in both machine development and customer value creation.
The COO also emphasized that customers, particularly municipalities, increasingly demand longer runtime per charge and a lower total cost of ownership (see Appendix A). If operators do not adjust their usage, customers risk experiencing shorter range than expected, which can negatively impact the machine's market positionfile.
In summary, Egholm faces an innovation opportunity that extends beyond technical optimization alone:

- there is a lack of detailed data on real-world usage,
- users have limited motivation to save energy (see Appendix A),
- past technical improvements have not changed operator behaviour (see Appendix A),
- and customers are demanding longer runtime and lower environmental impact (see Appendix A).
  This makes it crucial to develop solutions that combine technology and behaviouralinsight. The key question becomes: how can operators be guided toward smarter, more energy-efficient usage without adding complexity, and how can Egholm support this through design, data, and intuitive systems?

## **3 The Hard Nut**

The company's original challenge focused on improving the everyday energy efficiency of their E-Traktor and lowering operational costs for professional users, without negatively affecting workflow or user experience. The company operates in a market where electric machinery is increasingly attractive due to regulatory pressure, sustainability goals, and long-term cost considerations. However, high up-front investment, range limitations, and uncertainty about real-world performance still influence customer expectations. This makes efficient use of the electric drivetrain a central competitive parameter. Through early desk research and conversations with company representatives, we gained a clearer picture of the tractor's use context. The E-Traktor is typically operated by municipal workers, landscape contractors, and facility maintenance personnel. These operators often work under time pressure, perform repetitive tasks, and do not always have strong incentives to adjust machine settings for optimal energy usage. We believe that many users tend to run the tractor at maximum power, regardless of weather, task type, or terrain conditions, even in situations where lower power would be sufficient. During the first diamond phase, we explored this behaviour further. Interviews with operators highlighted several recurring themes?: / We debated and settled on the following beliefs?:

- Energy optimisation is not a priority for most users.
- Operators value simplicity and reliability over fine-tuning settings.
- Power adjustments are perceived as a potential limitation ("risk of the machine feeling too weak").
- Users often lack real-time feedback on how driving behaviour affects energy consumption.
- The responsibility for efficient usage is diffuse: the municipality pays the energy bill, but the operator decides the power setting.

## **4 Proposal Rationale**

Our proposal is centred on developing an Energy-Aware Assistance System (EAAS) for Egholm's E-Traktor: an interaction-driven support system that guides operators toward more energy-efficient behaviour through simple, real-time feedback and light-touch behavioural nudges. The system is designed to respect operators' needs for efficiency and control, while simultaneously helping Egholm and their customers reduce energy consumption, extend battery runtime, and document usage patterns.

## **4.1 Problem and Vision**

Throughout the project, we identified a core behavioural issue: operators consistently default to maximum power, regardless of the task, surface conditions, or the actual energy required. As our research and interviews showed, this behaviour is rooted not in laziness but in uncertainty and risk aversion—operators prefer predictability over optimisation. Combined with the absence of telematics and feedback systems, this leads to unnecessary energy consumption and reduced runtime.
The vision behind our proposal is therefore twofold:

- Enable operators to make smarter decisions without increasing cognitive load.
- Provide Egholm with data and tools that turn energy efficiency into a strategic advantage, both commercially and sustainably.
  The EAAS concept embodies this vision by creating a direct bridge between machine data, user behaviour, and energy-aware operation.

## **4.2 Problem Validation**

We validated the problem through multiple methods:

- Interviews with Egholm's COO and engineers, who highlighted the lack of data, the behaviourally driven inefficiencies, and the desire for non-intrusive ways to influence user behaviour.
- Desk research on the operational context of municipal electric machinery, which showed similar behavioural patterns in other segments.
- Technical insights from Egholm's internal testing, which confirmed that energy needs vary significantly depending on the task (e.g., wet vs. dry grass).
  These combined findings validate that the main "hard nut" is behavioural, not technical.

## **4.3 Proposed Solution**

The Energy-Aware Assistance System (EAAS) consists of three interconnected components:

- **Real-time feedback display:** A simple, colour-based indicator that informs the operator when the chosen power setting is suboptimal for the current task. The feedback is non-punitive, non-intrusive, and only appears when energy waste reaches a threshold.
- **Context-adaptive recommendations:** Using sensor input and preset task profiles (e.g., mowing wet grass, collecting leaves), the system can suggest switching to a more efficient power mode.
- **Data foundation for future telematics:** Even without full telematics integration, the display system prepares the organisation for later data collection. As Egholm plans to integrate telematics, the EAAS becomes a foundational layer for predictive optimisation, benchmarking, and customer reporting.

## **4.4 Strategic Benefits**

The proposal fulfils multiple needs for different stakeholders:

## **For Operators**

- Maintains full control while reducing cognitive workload.
- Avoids complex menus or overwhelming data.
- Supports task completion without performance anxiety ("will the machine be strong enough?").

## **For Municipalities and Customers**

- Reduced operating costs and extended runtime per charge.
- Potential documentation of energy savings and task efficiency.
- Increased reliability of fleet performance predictions.

## **For Egholm**

- A differentiator in a competitive electrified machinery market.
- A scalable foundation for telematics, AI optimisation, and future product development.
- A solution aligned with sustainability goals and growing ESG demands.

## **4.5 Stakeholder Management**

The key stakeholders include:
**Operators:** Must be supported with intuitive design, clear feedback, and a sense of autonomy.
**Municipal management:** Interested in cost savings, sustainability metrics, and predictable operations.
**Egholm Technical Team:** Needs usable sensor data and a system that integrates with planned telematics.
**Product development and sales teams:** Benefit from the ability to document real-world energy gains as a selling point.
Handling these stakeholders requires transparency, clear data flows, and ongoing communication. Pilots and training with operators ensure adoption, while aggregated anonymized data reassures municipalities about privacy and fairness.

## **4.6 Innovation and Value Proposition**

The innovative aspect of EAAS lies not in its individual components but in the integration of behavioural design with machine intelligence. Instead of forcing users to optimise manually or relying solely on hardware upgrades, the system:

- Translates complex energy patterns into simple, actionable cues.
- Respects operator experience and autonomy.
- Leverages data to improve over time.
- Shifts Egholm from reactive testing to continuous optimisation.
  The value proposition is clear: longer runtime, lower energy costs, smarter operation, and a stronger market position for Egholm.

## **4.7 Supporting Insights and Research**

The proposal rests on several research findings and tests:

- Behavioural analysis confirming operators' preference for simplicity and predictability.
- Technical insights showing large variations in power needs depending on conditions.
- Validation from Egholm that telematics is desired but not yet implemented, meaning a lightweight behavioural system is an ideal first step.
- Industry literature showing that gentle nudges, colour-based feedback, and simplified dashboards significantly change operational habits in professional electric equipment.

## **4.8 Solution Validation**

We validated the EAAS concept through:

- Feedback sessions with operators, who preferred the simplicity of the coloured display over complex menus.
- Discussions with Egholm's COO and engineers, who confirmed the technical feasibility and strategic relevance.
- Iterative design sessions, where different feedback mechanisms were tested for clarity, intrusiveness, and perceived usefulness.
  This combination of qualitative validation and technical grounding ensures that the solution is realistic, adoptable, and aligned with Egholm's future direction.

## **5 Prototype**

## **6 Business and Economic Perspective**

During our visit to Egholm's offices and production facilities, we gained a clear understanding of the economic and business-related challenges the company faces in developing their next generation of electric utility machines. One key insight was that the battery for the new model accounts for approximately 25% of the total production cost of the machine. This means that any improvement which can extend runtime or reduce unnecessary energy consumption has a direct and significant economic impact for both Egholm and their customers. Egholm already invests in extensive physical testing to understand battery performance under various operating conditions. We were told that the company has driven prototypes all the way to Switzerland to test the machines in extremely cold mountain environments. Cold temperatures have a major impact on battery capacity and efficiency, and such tests are necessary to ensure reliability and competitiveness across markets. However, these testing methods are also time-consuming, expensive, and logistically complex. In continuation of this, we see a strong business potential in combining Egholm's own initial test measurements with future telematics. Before telematics can deliver precise recommendations, Egholm needs to conduct a series of baseline tests under controlled conditions, for example:

- how much power is required for dry vs. wet grass
- how load changes depending on gravel type or surface conditions
- how moisture, resistance, and tool type influence energy consumption
  These internal test results will provide a "reference map" of expected energy usage under different scenarios. After that, telematics can be used to measure, adjust, and learn during real-world operation, allowing the optimization system to become more accurate over time. The combination of initial targeted testing + continuous telematics data offers a cheaper, smarter, and far more scalable method compared to Egholm's current approach. This method provides two major economic advantages:

1. It scales almost for free. Once telematics is integrated, Egholm can collect data from all machines in operation without additional travel costs, test facilities, or personnel. This turns energy optimization into a continuous process instead of a costly project. 2. It reduces the need for expensive physical stress tests. Egholm will still need occasional specific tests (e.g., extreme cold), but much of the work that today requires international test trips can instead be supplemented or partially replaced by analysis of real operational data from customers. This provides faster feedback, lower costs, and deeper insight into actual usage conditions.
   For customers, the economic benefits are equally clear: if the machine can intelligently adjust power usage, or if operators are guided toward more energy-efficient behaviour, they gain longer runtime per charge and therefore lower operating costs. Since the battery alone represents a quarter of the machine's price, it becomes a significant selling point if Egholm can document that their machines utilize battery capacity as efficiently as possible. Overall, this combined approach supports a strong business case. Egholm can:

- reduce development costs
- shorten the time required for product improvements
- strengthen their ESG profile with documented energy savings
- offer customers tangible economic advantages
- differentiate themselves in a market where energy efficiency is becoming a decisive competitive factor
  Thus, energy optimization becomes not just a technical project but a strategic business tool with direct economic impact.

## **7 Further perspectives**

The Energy-Aware Assistance System (EAAS) presents significant opportunities for expansion and refinement beyond its initial implementation. Several strategic directions emerge that could enhance both the system's capabilities and Egholm's market position.

## **7.1 Long-term AI Development**

As the system accumulates operational data from diverse environments and user behaviors, machine learning algorithms could evolve from reactive feedback to predictive optimization. The EAAS could learn to anticipate energy demands based on historical patterns, weather forecasts, and task-specific requirements. This advancement would enable proactive suggestions, such as optimal charging schedules or route planning that minimizes energy consumption while maximizing productivity.

## **7.2 Data-Driven Product Evolution**

The operational data collected through EAAS sensors represents a valuable asset for Egholm's product development pipeline. Aggregated anonymized usage patterns could inform future tractor designs, battery configurations, and feature prioritization. This datadriven approach would create a feedback loop where user behavior insights continuously improve hardware and software solutions.

## **7.3 Multi-Task Optimization**

While initially focused on general operational efficiency, the EAAS framework could be specialized for different municipal tasks. Separate optimization profiles for mowing wet grass, vacuuming in high humidity, snow removal, or leaf collection would account for the unique energy demands of each activity. This specialization would maximize efficiency gains across Egholm's diverse product applications.

## **7.4 Gamification and Behavioral Scaling**

Building on the positive reinforcement principles, expanded gamification features could include fleet-wide leaderboards, efficiency challenges between operators, and recognition programs. Such elements would foster a culture of sustainable operation across municipal organizations, potentially leading to broader adoption of electric equipment and reduced carbon footprints.

## **7.5 Integration with Broader Sustainability Initiatives**

The EAAS could serve as a foundation for comprehensive sustainability management systems. Integration with municipal energy monitoring platforms, carbon accounting tools, or smart city infrastructure would position Egholm's tractors as key components in larger environmental initiatives. This ecosystem approach would enhance the perceived value of Egholm's products beyond mere equipment sales.

## **7.6 Technical and Market Expansion**

From a technical perspective, the sensor and feedback framework could be adapted for other electric utility vehicles in Egholm's portfolio. Market expansion opportunities include partnerships with software providers for advanced analytics or collaborations with municipalities for pilot programs that demonstrate measurable environmental impact. These perspectives illustrate how the EAAS transcends its initial scope as a behavioral optimization tool, evolving into a comprehensive platform for sustainable equipment management. The system's success would not only extend operational efficiency but also establish Egholm as a leader in human-centered, data-driven sustainability solutions. [1]

**From:** Eggholm A/S Representative
**To:** Martin
**Subject:** Response to Questions about Case Project
**Date:** October 2023
Hej Martin,
Jeg skriver på vegne af Gruppe 58, der har fået jeres case. Vi glæder os super meget til at arbejde med jeres firma. Vi har nogle praktiske spørgsmål som vi håber du kan hjælpe med at svare på så vi kan komme forberedt på onsdag 29/10.

- 1. Indsamler I allerede nogle former for data som vi kan få adgang til? Bruger I GPS så man ikke kører over det samme sted 2 gange? Har I noget data på hvornår jeres maskiner kører optimalt *→* ikke optimalt?
  - I dag anvender Egholm ikke 'GPS' overvågning på maskiner i drift. Dog har vi i forbindelse med det seneste projekt arbejdet med en leverandør omkring en fremtidig telematik løsning.
- 2. I spørger om det er muligt at indarbejde en form for motivation for brugeren af maskinerne til at bruge dem på en måde, hvor de bruger mindst mulig energi.
     Vi ved at brugere anvender maskinerne forskelligt, f.eks. max. sugekapacitet på opsamlingstanken, også når det ikke er nødvendigt.
     Er det fordi I allerede ved hvilke områder der kan forbedres?
- 3. Har I haft prøvet at løse disse problemer før, hvis ja, har i haft nogle succeser? Har I mødt nogle "dead ends"?
  - Vi har bl.a. indført en række forbedringer i produkterne (f.eks. SW) som er uafhængige af brugerens adfærd.
  - Udgangspunktet for brugeren af maskinen er at opgaves løses bedst mulig og mindre fokus på energiforbrug. Det er her vi ønsker ideer der kan være med til at ændre brugerens adfærd.
- 4. Hvad er jeres motivation for at forbedre kundernes brug af maskinerne?
  - Forbedret brug af maskiner skal komme både brugere (f.eks. mindre energiforbrug\*→\*længere driftstid), kunder (f.eks. reduceret støj, støv mm.) og ikke mindst en lavere miljøbelastning.
